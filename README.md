# unbiased_mcmc_with_couplings

Implementation of "Unbiased Markov-Chain Monte Carlo estimators with couplings". Project done as part of the Bayesian
Machine Learning course by Rémi Bardenet

It includes a coupled Metropolis-Hasting algorithm, and the Thorisson's coupling Algorithm.
Some scripts to test the algorithms on simple examples, in particular, reproduction of some examples from the paper.

The R companion-code of the paper is available
at [https://github.com/pierrejacob/unbiasedmcmc](https://github.com/pierrejacob/unbiasedmcmc).

# How?
See the `experiments` folder for some examples of how to use the package.
